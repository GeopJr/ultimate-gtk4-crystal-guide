# Introduction

The [first app section](/en/first-app/plan.html) is somewhat opinionated and doesn't always match the latest and greatest the bindings have to offer. Instead, let's translate the [GNOME Beginner's Tutorial](https://developer.gnome.org/documentation/tutorials/beginners.html) in Crystal!

It requires libadwaita, but the concepts can be used for plain GTK, Granite or other widget library development! We are going to build a basic text viewer.

99% of the tutorial is copied straight from [GNOME Beginner's Tutorial](https://developer.gnome.org/documentation/tutorials/beginners.html), written by its contributors.
